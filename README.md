# temploapiclient

`temploapiclient` is a lightweight REST client built on [httpeasyrest](https://github.com/d2gex/httpeasyrest)
designed to consume the API made available by the [TEMPLO](https://galtrackingnet.com/en/research/list-projects/projects/templo-new-technologies-for-the-observation-of-the-marine-environment-implementation-of-live-acoustic-telemetry-on-observation-platforms/) project.
Live data is transmitted directly from the ocean every two minutes, either from a coastal network of receptors measuring 
oceanographic variables or from fish equipped with small transmitters for detection. 

Detections are generated by tags surgically implanted in fish, which emit signals as the these pass by any hydrophone in 
the deployed acoustic telemetry network. In addition to tracking detections, these tags measure physical variables such 
as depth, pressure, and temperature.

# Entity Relationship Diagram
The entity-relationship model of the underlying database over which the API has been built is shown below.
